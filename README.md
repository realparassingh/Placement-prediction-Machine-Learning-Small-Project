# Placement-prediction-Machine-Learning-Small-Project

--> We are preprocessing the dataset whether it contains any null values or fake entries that may affect our result. <br/>
--> The independent variables of this dataset are cgpa and iq, while the dependent dataset is placement. <br/>
--> We are putting the cgpa and iq in x variable, while placement in y variable.
